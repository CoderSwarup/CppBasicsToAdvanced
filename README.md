## C++ Development Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up a C++ development environment on your computer.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
- C++ compiler like g++ (for Linux/macOS) or Visual C++ (for Windows).
- Terminal or Command Prompt for running commands.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install a Text Editor or IDE

Choose a text editor or IDE for writing and editing your C++ code. Popular options include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)

### 2. Install a C++ Compiler

- **Linux/macOS:** Most Linux distributions come with g++ pre-installed. You can open a terminal and type `g++ --version` to check. If it's not installed, you can use your package manager to install it.

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install g++
  ```
